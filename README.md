Hi! Here are all the scripts related to the game Be Your Hero. A 2D adventure platformer where the protagonist Jack has to save little Maxie.
The scripts range from the game manager, sound manager, character movement, power-ups, obstacles, to screens and other UI elements such as time.
The code uses C# as the language and its purpose was to implement it in Unity for the game to run.
